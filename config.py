# ─── The service ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# `127.0.0.1` is loopback — only your own machine can reach it, which is what
# you want all through units 7 and 8. A host somewhere else has to accept
# traffic from outside the box, and that means `0.0.0.0`. Setting the env var
# is how you get it; the default keeps your local `curl` commands unchanged.

# Python prompt inside your process. Fine on loopback, a gift to strangers
# anywhere else — so it turns itself off the moment HOST isn't loopback.

# ─── The local model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Your first signal runs a language model ON YOUR OWN MACHINE. No account, no
# key, no card. It downloads about 550 MB the first time — do that before
# class, not during it.
#
# What it measures: how *predictable* your text is to a language model. Text a
# model finds easy to predict tends to be text a model wrote.
#
# The first call is the slow one — ten to twenty seconds while the model loads,
# longer on an older laptop. After that it stays in memory and a submission
# takes a second or two. That cost is part of what you're learning: this is
# what running a model inline in a request actually looks like.
